![keyboard-layout-editor.com layout](./keyboard-layout-editor.png)

This is a swedish layout using [colemak-se](https://github.com/motform/colemak-se) and a symbols layer tailored towards developers.

In addition to using colemak-se it also has backspace in place of caps lock to reduce the need of moving your hands.
